# webpack-boilerplate
This repository is a boilerplate for developing
web frontend which incorporates
`babel`, `webpack`, and polyfill `core-js`.

`webpack` automatically loads and execute `babel`
when processing `*.js` files as defined in
`module` property in `webpack.config.js` file.

Consider importing `css-loader`, `sass-loader`, and
`style-loader` if you want to import css classes
in JS files.
